    Fixed an additional regression in the same area as that of :ticket:`5080`
    introduced in 1.3.0b3 via :ticket:`4468` where the ability to create a
    joined option across a :func:`.with_polymorphic` into a relationship
    against the base class of that with_polymorphic, and then further into
    regular mapped relationships would fail as the base class component would
    not add itself to the load path in a way that could be located by the
    loader strategy. The changes applied in :ticket:`5080` have been further
    refined to also accommodate this scenario.
