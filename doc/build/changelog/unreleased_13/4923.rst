    :tickets: 4923

    Fixed an issue in the :meth:`.Engine.table_names` method where it would
    feed the dialect's default schema name back into the dialect level table
    function, which in the case of SQL Server would interpret it as a
    dot-tokenized schema name as viewed by the mssql dialect, which would
    cause the method to fail in the case where the database username actually
    had a dot inside of it.  In 1.3, this method is still used by the
    :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` function so is a prominent codepath. In 1.4,
    which is the current master development branch, this issue doesn't exist,
    both because :meth:`.MetaData.reflect` isn't using this method nor does the
    method pass the default schema name explicitly.  The fix nonetheless
    guards against the default server name value returned by the dialect from
    being interpreted as dot-tokenized name under any circumstances by
    wrapping it in quoted_name().
