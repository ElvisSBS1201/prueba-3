   Enhanced MySQL/MariaDB version string parsing to accommodate for exotic
   MariaDB version strings where the "MariaDB" word is embedded among other
   alphanumeric characters such as "MariaDBV1".   This detection is critical in
   order to correctly accomodate for API features that have split between MySQL
   and MariaDB such as the "transaction_isolation" system variable.
