    :tickets: 5110

    Fixed regression caused in 1.3.13 by :ticket:`5056` where a refactor of the
    ORM path registry system made it such that a path could no longer be
    compared to an empty tuple, which can occur in a particular kind of joined
    eager loading path.   The "empty tuple" use case has been resolved so that
    the path registry is compared to a path registry in all cases;  the
    :class:`.PathRegistry` object itself now implements ``__eq__()`` and
    ``__ne__()`` methods which will take place for all equality comparisons and
    continue to succeed in the not anticipated case that a non-
    :class:`.PathRegistry` object is compared, while emitting a warning that
    this object should not be the subject of the comparison.
