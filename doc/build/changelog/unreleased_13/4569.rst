    The :class:`.GenericFunction` namespace is being migrated so that function
    names are looked up in a case-insensitive manner, as SQL  functions do not
    collide on case sensitive differences nor is this something which would
    occur with user-defined functions or stored procedures.   Lookups for
    functions declared with :class:`.GenericFunction` now use a case
    insensitive scheme,  however a deprecation case is supported which allows
    two or more :class:`.GenericFunction` objects with the same name of
    different cases to exist, which will cause case sensitive lookups to occur
    for that particular name, while emitting a warning at function registration
    time.  Thanks to Adrien Berchet for a lot of work on this complicated
    feature.
