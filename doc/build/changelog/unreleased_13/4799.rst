    Added dialect-level flag ``encoding_errors`` to the cx_Oracle dialect,
    which can be specified as part of :func:`.create_engine`.   This is passed
    to SQLAlchemy's unicode decoding converter under Python 2, and to
    cx_Oracle's ``cursor.var()`` object as the ``encodingErrors`` parameter
    under Python 3, for the very unusual case that broken encodings are present
    in the target database which cannot be fetched unless error handling is
    relaxed.  The value is ultimately one of the Python "encoding errors"
    parameters passed to ``decode()``.
