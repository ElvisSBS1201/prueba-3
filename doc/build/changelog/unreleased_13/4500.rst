   Change StatementError formatting (newlines and %s)
    
   This changes the error formatting for StatementError in two ways:
   
   1) Break each error detail up over multiple newlines instead of
      spaced out on a single line. Hopefully, this helps readers scan
      the error message more easily.
   
   2) Change the SQL representation in the message to use __str__ (%s)
      instead of the current behavior that uses __repr__ (%r). This
      should help readers recognize the structure of their SQL,
      particularly if it is a multiline SQL statement. In the multiline
      case, the SQL would be printed over multiple lines instead of
      printing an escaped "\n".
