	In SqlAlchemy 1.4, several operators will be renamed to achieve more
	consistent naming across SqlAlchemy.

	The first targeted operator changes:
		
	* `isnot` will become `is_not`
	* `not_in_` will become `not_in`

	Because these are core operators, the internal migration strategy for this
	change is to support legacy terms for an extended period of time -- if not
	indefinitely -- but update all documentation, tutorials, and internal usage
	to the new terms.  The new terms will be used to define the functions, and
	the legacy terms will be deprecated into aliases of the new terms.

	In preparation for this change, the same standardization is being applied to
	these corollary terms in the testing suite:

	* `is_not_` is now `is_not`
	* `not_in_` is now `not_in`
	
	To keep from breaking any third-party packages which rely on the
	test-suite, any files which imported the legacy terms will now import both
	the legacy and standardized terms, however they will only use the legacy
	terms.
