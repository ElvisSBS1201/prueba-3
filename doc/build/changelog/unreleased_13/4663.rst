   Moved the "rollback" which occurs during dialect initialization so that it
   occurs after additional dialect-specific initialize steps, in particular
   those of the psycopg2 dialect which would inadvertently leave transactional
   state on the first new connection, which could interfere with some
   psycopg2-specific APIs which require that no transaction is started.  Pull
   request courtesy Matthew Wilkes.
