    Fixed bug where parameter repr as used in logging and error reporting needs
    additional context in order to distinguish between a list of parameters for
    a single statement and a list of parameter lists, as the "list of lists"
    structure could also indicate a single parameter list where the first
    parameter itself is a list, such as for an array parameter.   The
    engine/connection now passes in an additional boolean indicating how the
    parameters should be considered.  The only SQLAlchemy backend that expects
    arrays as parameters is that of  psycopg2 which uses pyformat parameters,
    so this issue has not been too apparent, however as other drivers that use
    positional gain more features it is important that this be supported. It
    also eliminates the need for the parameter repr function to guess based on
    the parameter structure passed.
