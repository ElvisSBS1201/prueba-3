    Towards maintaining consistency with unit-of-work changes made for
    :ticket:`5984` and :ticket:`8862`, both of which disable "lazy='raise'"
    handling within :class:`_orm.Session` processes that aren't triggered by
    attribute access, the :meth:`_orm.Session.delete` method will now also
    disable "lazy='raise'" handling when it traverses relationship paths in
    order to process the "delete" and "delete-orphan" cascade rules.
    Previously, there was no easy way to generically call
    :meth:`_orm.Session.delete` on an object that had "lazy='raise'" set up
    such that only the necessary relationships would be loaded. As
    "lazy='raise'" is primarily intended to catch SQL loading that emits on
    attribute access, :meth:`_orm.Session.delete` is now made to behave like
    other :class:`_orm.Session` methods including :meth:`_orm.Session.merge` as
    well as :meth:`_orm.Session.flush` along with autoflush.
