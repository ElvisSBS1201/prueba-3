    Fixed issue in stringify for SQL elements, where a specific dialect is not
    passed,  where a dialect-specific element such as the PostgreSQL "on
    conflict do update" construct is encountered and then fails to provide for
    a stringify dialect with the appropriate state to render the construct,
    leading to internal errors.

.. change::
    :tags: bug, sql

    Fixed issue where stringifying or compiling a :class:`.CTE` that was
    against a DML construct such as an :func:`_sql.insert` construct would fail
    to stringify, due to a mis-detection that the statement overall is an
    INSERT, leading to internal errors.
