    For improved security, :class:`engine.URL` gets its ``__str__`` method
    removed to avoid accidental password leakage. ``str(engine.URL())`` will
    now fallback to :method:`engine.URL.__repr__` which censors the password.
    :method:`engine.URL.render_as_string(hide_password=False)` is still
    available for cases when clear text password is necessary.
