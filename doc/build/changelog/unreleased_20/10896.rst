    Replaced the "loader depth is excessively deep" warning with a shorter
    message added to the caching badge within SQL logging, for those statements
    where the ORM disabled the cache due to a too-deep chain of loader options.
    The condition which this warning highlights is difficult to resolve and is
    generally just a limitation in the ORM's application of SQL caching. A
    future feature may include the ability to tune the threshold where caching
    is disabled, but for now the warning will no longer be a nuisance.
