    Reworked how numeric paramstyle behavers, in particular, fixed insertmany
    behaviour that prior to this was non functional; added support for repeated
    parameter without duplicating them like in other positional dialects;
    introduced new numeric paramstyle called ``numeric_dollar`` that can be
    used to render statements that use the PostgreSQL placeholder style (
    i.e. ``$1, $2, $3``).
    This change requires that the dialect supports out of order placehoders,
    that may be used used in the statements, in particular when using
    insert-many values with statement that have parameters in the returning
    clause.
