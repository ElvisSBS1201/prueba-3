    Adjusted the MySQL / MariaDB dialects to default a generated column to NULL
    when using MariaDB, if :paramref:`_schema.Column.nullable` was not
    specified with an explicit ``True`` or ``False`` value, as MariaDB does not
    support the "NOT NULL" phrase with a generated column.  Pull request
    courtesy Indivar.
