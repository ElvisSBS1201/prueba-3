    Fixed issues in :func:`_sql.case` where the logic for determining the
    type of the expression could result in :class:`.NullType` if the last
    element in the "whens" had no type, or in other cases where the type
    could resolve to ``None``.  The logic has been updated to scan all
    given expressions so that the first non-null type is used, as well as
    to always ensure a type is present.  Pull request courtesy David Evans.
