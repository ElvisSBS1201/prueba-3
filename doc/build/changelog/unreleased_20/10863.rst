    Fixed regression in the asyncpg dialect caused by :ticket:`10717` in
    release 2.0.24 where the change that now attempts to gracefully close the
    asyncpg connection before terminating would not fall back to
    ``terminate()`` for other potential connection-related exceptions other
    than a timeout error, not taking into account cases where the graceful
    ``.close()`` attempt fails for other reasons such as connection errors.
