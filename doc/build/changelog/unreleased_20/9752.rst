    Added new :func:`.try_cast` factory function and corresponding
    :class:`.TryCast` SQL Element, which implements a cast where
    un-castable values are returned as NULL, instead of raising an error.

    This is currently implemented as ``TRY_CAST`` in Microsoft SQL Server.
    and could be implemented in other backends:
    * ``SAFE_CAST`` in Google BigQuery, and
    * ``TRY_CAST`` in DuckDB.
    * ``TRY_CAST`` in Snowflake.
