    Generalized the MSSQL :func:`.try_cast` function so that other
    extension dialects can use it (MSSQL is the only builtin dialect
    that currently supports it).

    This implements a cast where
    un-castable values are returned as NULL, instead of raising an error.
    These are a few third party dialects that could implement this:

    * ``SAFE_CAST`` in Google BigQuery
    * ``TRY_CAST`` in DuckDB
    * ``TRY_CAST`` in Snowflake
