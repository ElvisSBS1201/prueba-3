    Generalized the MSSQL :func:`.try_cast` function to any dialect.
    This implements a cast where
    un-castable values are returned as NULL, instead of raising an error.
    Now this function can be taken advantage of by third party dialects
    that also support this function, such as

    * ``SAFE_CAST`` in Google BigQuery
    * ``TRY_CAST`` in DuckDB
    * ``TRY_CAST`` in Snowflake
