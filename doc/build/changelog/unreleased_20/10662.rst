    Fixed URL-encoding of the username and password components of
    :class:`.engine.URL` objects when converting them to string using the
    :meth:`_engine.URL.render_as_string` method, by using Python standard
    library ``urllib.parse.quote`` while allowing for plus signs and spaces to
    remain unchanged as supported by SQLAlchemy's non-standard URL parsing,
    rather than the legacy home-grown routine from many years ago. Pull request
