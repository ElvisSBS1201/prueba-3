    Added a new default value for the :paramref:`.Mapper.eager_defaults`
    parameter "auto", which will automatically fetch table default values
    during a unit of work flush, if the dialect supports RETURNING for the
    INSERT being run, as well as
    :ref:`insertmanyvalues <engine_insertmanyvalues>` available. Eager fetches
    for server-side UPDATE defaults, which are very uncommon, continue to only
    take place if :paramref:`.Mapper.eager_defaults` is set to ``True``, as
    there is no batch-RETURNING form for UPDATE statements.
