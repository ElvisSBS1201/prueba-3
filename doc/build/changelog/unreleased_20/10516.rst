    Fixed issue where the ``__allow_unmapped__`` directive failed to allow for
    legacy :class:`.Column` / :func:`.deferred` mappings that nonetheless had
    annotations such as ``Any`` or a specific type without ``Mapped[]`` as
    their type, without errors related to locating the attribute name.
