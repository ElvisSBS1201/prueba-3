    Complementing :ticket:`8690`, new comparison methods such as
    ``adjacent_to()``, ``difference()``, ``union()``, etc., were added to the
    PG-specific range objects, bringing them in par with the standard
    operators implemented by the underlying
    :attr:`_postgresql.AbstractRange.comparator_factory`. Pull request
