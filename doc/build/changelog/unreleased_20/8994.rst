    To accommodate for third party dialects with different character escaping
    needs regarding bound parameters, the system by which SQLAlchemy "escapes"
    (i.e., replaces with another character in its place) special characters in
    bound parameter names has been made extensible for third party dialects,
    using the :attr:`.SQLCompiler.bindname_escape_chars` dictionary which can
    be overridden at the class declaration level on any :class:`.SQLCompiler`
    subclass. As part of this change, also added the dot ``"."`` as a default
    "escaped" character.
