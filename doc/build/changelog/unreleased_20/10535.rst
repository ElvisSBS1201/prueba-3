    Added compiler-level None/NULL handling for the "literal processors" of all
    datatypes that include literal processing, that is, where a value is
    rendered inline within a SQL statement rather than as a bound parameter,
    for all those types that do not feature explicit "null value" handling.
    Previously this behavior was undefined and inconsistent.
