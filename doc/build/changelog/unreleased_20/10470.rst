    Fixed issue where the cx_Oracle dialect claimed to support a lower
    cx_Oracle version (7.x) than was actually supported in practice within the
    2.0 series of SQLAlchemy. The dialect imports symbols that are only in
    cx_Oracle 8 or higher, so runtime dialect checks as well as setup.cfg
    requirements have been updated to reflect this compatibility.
