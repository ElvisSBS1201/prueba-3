    Removed the requirement that the ``__allow_unmapped__`` attribute be used
    on Declarative Dataclass Mapped class when non-``Mapped[]`` annotations are
    detected; previously, an error message that was intended to support legacy
    ORM typed mappings would be raised, which additionally did not mention
    correct patterns to use with Dataclasses specifically. This error message
    is now no longer raised if :meth:`_orm.registry.mapped_as_dataclass` or
    :class:`_orm.MappedAsDataclass` is used.
