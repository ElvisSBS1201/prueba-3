    Improvements to the test suite to further harden its ability to run
    when Python ``greenlet`` is not installed.   There is now a tox
    target that includes the token "nogreenlet" that will run the suite
    with greenlet not installed (note that it still temporarily installs
    greenlet as part of the tox config, however).
