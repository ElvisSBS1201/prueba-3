    Improved the error message produced when the unit of work process sets the
    value of a primary key column to NULL due to a related object with a
    dependency rule on that column being deleted, to include not just the
    destination object and column name but also the source column from which
    the NULL value is originating.  Pull request courtesy Jan Vollmer.
