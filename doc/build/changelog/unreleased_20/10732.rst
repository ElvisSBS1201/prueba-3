    Modified the ``__init_subclass__()`` method used by
    :class:`_orm.MappedAsDataclass`, :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBase`` and
    :class:`_orm.DeclarativeBaseNoMeta` to accept arbitrary ``**kw`` and to
    propagate them to the ``super()`` call, allowing greater flexibility in
    arranging custom superclasses and mixins which make use of
    ``__init_subclass__()`` keyword arguments.  Pull request courtesy Michael
    Oliver.
