    Modified the :class:`.DeclarativeMeta` metaclass to pass ``cls.__dict__``
    into the declarative scanning process to look for attributes, rather than
    the separate dictionary passed to the type's ``__init__()`` method. This
    allows user-defined base classes that add attributes within an
    ``__init_subclass__()`` to work as expected, as ``__init_subclass__()`` can
    only affect the ``cls.__dict__`` itself and not the other dictionary. This
    is technically a regression from 1.3 where ``__dict__`` was being used.
