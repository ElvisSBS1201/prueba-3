    Fixed issue in recently repaired ``Query.with_entities()`` method where the
    flag that determines automatic uniquing for legacy ORM ``Query`` objects
    only would be set to ``True`` inappropriately in cases where the
    ``with_entities()`` call would be setting the ``Query`` to return
    column-only rows, which are not uniqued.
