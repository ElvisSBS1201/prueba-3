    Fixed bug in "relationship to aliased class" feature introduced at
    :ref:`relationship_aliased_class` where it was not possible to create a
    loader strategy option targeting an attribute on the target using the
    :func:`_orm.aliased` construct directly in a second loader option, such as
    ``selectinload(A.aliased_bs).joinedload(aliased_b.cs)``, without explicitly
    qualifying using :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.of_type` on the preceding
    element of the path. Additionally, targeting the non-aliased class directly
    would be accepted (inappropriately), but would silently fail, such as
    ``selectinload(A.aliased_bs).joinedload(B.cs)``; this now raises an error
    referring to the typing mismatch.
