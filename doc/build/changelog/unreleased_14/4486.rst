    Added a CAST(VARCHAR2(128)) to the "table name", "owner", and other
    DDL-name parameters as used in reflection queries against Oracle system
    views such as ALL_TABLES, ALL_TAB_CONSTRAINTS, etc to better enable
    indexing to take place against these columns, as they previously would be
    implicitly handled as NVARCHAR2 due to Python's use of Unicode for strings;
    these columns are documented in all Oracle versions as being VARCHAR2 with
    lengths varying from 30 to 128 characters depending on server version.
    Additionally, test support has been enabled for Unicode-named DDL
    structures against Oracle databases.
