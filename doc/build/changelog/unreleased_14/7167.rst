    Reorganized the list of reserved words into two separate lists, one for
    MySQL and one for MariaDB, so that these diverging sets of words can be
    managed more accurately; adjusted the MySQL/MariaDB dialect to switch among
    these lists based on either explicitly configured or
    server-version-detected "MySQL" or "MariaDB" backend. Added all current
    reserved words through MySQL 8 and current MariaDB versions including
    recently added keywords like "lead" . Pull request courtesy Kevin Kirsche.
