    The ``RowProxy`` class is no longer a "proxy" object, and is instead
    directly populated with the post-processed contents of the DBAPI row tuple
    upon construction.   Now named :class:`.Row`, the mechanics of how the
    Python-level value processors have been simplified, particularly as it impacts the
    format of the C code, so that a DBAPI row is processed into a result tuple
    up front.   See the migration notes for further details.
