    Fixed regression where the change in #7861, released in version 1.4.33,
    that brought the :class:`.Insert` construct to be partially recognized as
    an ORM-enabled statement did not properly transfer the correct mapper /
    mapped table state to the :class:`.Session`, causing the
    :meth:`.Session.get_bind` method to fail for a :class:`.Session` that was
    bound to engines and/or connections using the :paramref:`.Session.binds`
    parameter.
