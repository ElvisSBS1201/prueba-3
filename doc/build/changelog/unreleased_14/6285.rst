    Adjusted the means by which classes such as :class:`_orm.scoped_session`
    and :class:`_asyncio.AsyncSession` are generated from the base
    :class:`_orm.Session` class, such that custom :class:`_orm.Session`
    subclasses such as that used by Flask-SQLAlchemy don't need to implement
    positional arguments when they call into the superclass method, and can
    continue using the same argument styles as in previous releases.
