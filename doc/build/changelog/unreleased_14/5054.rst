    Creating an :func:`.and_` or :func:`.or_` construct with no arguments or
    empty ``*args`` will now emit a deprecation warning, as the SQL produced is
    a no-op (i.e. it renders as a blank string). This behavior is considered to
    be non-intuitive, so for empty or possibly empty :func:`.and_` or
    :func:`.or_` constructs, an appropriate default boolean should be included,
    such as ``and_(True, *args)`` or ``or_(False, *args)``.   As has been the
    case for many major versions of SQLAlchemy, these particular boolean
    values will not render if the ``*args`` portion is non-empty.
