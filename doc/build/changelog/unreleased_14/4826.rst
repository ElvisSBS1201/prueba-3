    :tags: feature, orm
    :tickets: 4826

    Added "raiseload" feature for ORM mapped columns via :paramref:`.orm.defer.raiseload`
    parameter on :func:`.defer` and :func:`.deferred`.   This provides
    similar behavior for column-expression mapped attributes as the
    :func:`.raiseload` option does for relationship mapped attributes.  The
    change also includes some behavioral changes to deferred columns regarding
    expiration; see the migration notes for details.
