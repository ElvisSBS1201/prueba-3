    Added "from linting" as a built-in feature to the SQL compiler.  This
    allows the compiler to maintain graph of all the FROM clauses in a
    particular SELECT statement, linked by criteria in either the WHERE
    or in JOIN clauses that link these FROM clauses together.  If any two
    FROM clauses have no path between them, a warning is emitted that the
    query may be producing a cartesian product.   As the Core expression
    language as well as the ORM are built on an "implicit FROMs" model where
    a particular FROM clause is automatically added if any part of the query
    refers to it, it is easy for this to happen inadvertently and it is
    hoped that the new feature helps with this issue.
