    Fixed 1.4 regression where :meth:`_orm.Query.filter_by` would not function
    correctly when :meth:`_orm.Query.join` were joined to an entity which made
    use of :meth:`_orm.PropComparator.of_type` to specify an aliased version of
    the target entity. The issue also applies to future style ORM queries
    constructed with :func:`_sql.select`.
