    Fixed issue where a bound parameter object that was "cloned" would cause a
    name conflict in the compiler, if more than one clone of this parameter
    were used at the same time in a single statement. This could occur in
    particular with things like ORM single table inheritance queries that
    indicated the same "discriminator" value multiple times in one query.
