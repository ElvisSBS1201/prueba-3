   With SqlAlchemy 1.4, several operators have been renamed to be more consistent
   with the naming of other SqlAlchemy terms:
   
   * `isnot` is now `is_not`
   * `notin_` is now `not_in`
   
   Because these are core operators, the internal migration strategy for this
   change is to support the legacy terms for an extended period of time -- if not
   indefinitely -- but update all documentation, tutorials, and internal usage
   to the new terms.
   
   The legacy operators have been deprecated into aliases of the new terms.
