   With SqlAlchemy 1.4, several operators have been renamed to be more consistent
   with the naming of other SqlAlchemy terms:

   * `isnot` is now `is_not`
   * `not_in_` is now `not_in`

   Because these are core operators, the internal migration strategy for this
   change is to support the legacy terms for an extended period of time -- if not
   indefinitely -- but update all documentation, tutorials, and internal usage
   to the new terms.

   The legacy operators have been deprecated into aliases of the new terms.

   Associated testing terms have also been standardized with similar deprecations:

   * `is_not_` is now `is_not`
   * `not_in_` is now `not_in`
