    Fixed issue in future :class:`_future.Engine` where calling upon
    :meth:`_future.Engine.begin` and entering the context manager would not
    close the connection if the actual BEGIN operation failed for some reason,
    such as an event handler raising an exception; this use case failed to be
    tested for the future version of the engine. Note that the "future" context
    managers which handle ``begin()`` blocks in Core and ORM don't actually run
    the "BEGIN" operation until the context managers are actually entered. This
    is different from the legacy version which runs the "BEGIN" operation up
    front.
