   Refactored the internal conventions used to cross-import modules that have
   mutual dependencies between them, such that the inspected arguments of
   functions and methods are no longer modified.  This allows tools like
   pylint, Pycharm, other code linters, as well as hypothetical pep-484
   implementations added in the future to function correctly as they no longer
   see missing arguments to function calls.   The new approach is also
   simpler and more performant.
