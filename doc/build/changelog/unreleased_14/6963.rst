    :tickets: 6963

    Fixed issue where an engine that had ``implicit_returning`` set to False
    would fail to function when PostgreSQL's "fast insertmany" feature were
    used in conjunction with a ``Sequence``, as well as if any kind of
    "executemany" with "return_defaults()" were used in conjunction with a
    ``Sequence``. Note that PostgreSQL "fast insertmany" uses "RETURNING" by
    definition, when the SQL statement is passed to the driver; overall, the
    ``implicit_returning`` flag is legacy and has no real use in modern
    SQLAlchemy, and will be deprecated in a separate change.
